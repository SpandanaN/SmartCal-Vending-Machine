# SmartCal-Vending-Machine
<p>SmartCal is a model of a smart Vending machine that provides healthy snacks and beverages to consumers. The vending machine displays a variety of food items and their prices. In addition, a consumer can get the caloric and other (sugar and fat contents etc) of a food item of their choice, using the interface display on vending machine. Consumers (also referred to as users) in the rest of the document, can pay with change or use a S​martCal​card that they can buy from the machine. SmartCal cards are usable on any S​martCal​machine, at any location.</p>

<li>Monitor the operation of the vending machine</li>
<li>Change the prices of items</li>
<li>Introduce new items.</li>
<li>Make the nutritional information available.</li>

#Design Methodolgy and Patterns Implemented
Bbuilt an Object-oriented model of the vending machine, simulating the functionality, using OO analysis and design techniques , design patterns and Java programming language.
The prototype demonstrates the functionality by providing a graphic-user interface that can be used to mimic the operation of the Vending machine and its usage from a consumer’s and operator’s point of view.

The designs patterns implemented in the SmartCal design are: 
<ul>
<li>Factory method</li>
<li>Builder pattern</li>
<li>Bridge pattern</li>
<li>State pattern</li>
<li>Observer pattern</li>
<li>Iterator pattern</li>
<li>Decorator pattern</li>
</ul>
